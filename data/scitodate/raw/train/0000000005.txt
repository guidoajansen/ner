The grab sampling method using Lucas scintillation cells (1 dm 3 Lucas covered by ZnS(Ag), M EV Ltd., Hungary) and an EMI photomultiplier were used to determine the radon concentrations.


Materials and methods



Activated sludge samples and DNA extraction

Activated sludge samples were collected from one industria l WWTP (plant A) and seven domestic WWTPs (plants B-H) located in Japan (Table SMTotal DNA of each activated sludge sample was extracted as follows: each activated sludge sample was centrifuged at 4000 g for 15 min and the total DNA of each sample was extracted from 250 mg of the wet precipita te using a NucleoSpin Soil kit (MACHEREY-NAG EL GmbH, KG, Germany). The DNA extract was cleaned up using a NucleoSpin gDNA Clean-up kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL GmbH, KG).


The jugular vein was cannulated and the cannulae were subsequently kept patent using a saline solution (50 units of heparin per milliliter saline, Multiparin, CP Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Wrexham, UK +300 mg crystapen antibiotic per 500 ml, Biochemie GmbH, Tirol, Austria).


., Hitchin, Hertfordshire, UK; EGFR Y845 and c-Src Y418 were from BioSource Europe S.A. (Fleures, Belgium), ErbB2 Y1248 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY); and -actin was from Sigma-Aldrich.


The absorbance was read at 540 nm with a EZ 400 microplate reader (Biochrom Ltd, Cambridge, UK) and the optical densities used to determine cell viability and to calculate IC 50 .


Cubes of cellular rigid polyurethane foam (Sawbones Europe AB, Malmö, Sweden) 50×50 mm with three different qualities were used to simulate "severely osteoporotic bone" (160 kg/m -3 ), "mildly osteoporotic bone" (240 kg/m -3 ), and "normal bone" (320 kg/m -3 ).


Subsequently, CD4  T cells were separated by high gradient magnetic sorting using the Variomacs technique (Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch-Gladbach, Germany). PBMC were incubated with saturating concentrations of CD4 mAb conjugated with paramagnetic microbeads for 15 min on ice, washed in PBS supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mM EDTA and separated according to the manufacturer's instructions.


The cross-sectional images obtained by pQCT were analyzed using BonAlyse software (BonAlyse Oy, Jyvaskyla, Finland), which automatically identifies cortical and trabecular bone and assesses its density.

ELISA and multiplex analyses

Serum levels of the following endothelial markers were measured by ELISA: sCD141 (soluble thrombomodulin, Diaclone, Besançone, France), suppressor of tumorigenicity-2 (ST2), interleukin-33 (R&D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, UK) and vascular endothelial growth factor (R&D Systems).


Briefly, A172 and T98G glioblastoma cells and primary-cultured astrocytes were cultured in different 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 5x10 3 cells/ well.


After identifying the origin of the occluded mesenteric artery, an attempt was made to cross the occlusion from below, using a Simonds shape catheter and 0.035 guide wire (Terumo Sweden AB, Sweden). If this failed, an attempt was made at using the same technique from the arm with a 4F Headhunter catheter (COOK Europe, Bjaereskov, Denmark) and 0.035 guide wire.


DNA Extraction

Paraffin-embedded tissues were macrodissected based on hematoxylin and eosin staining evaluations to ensure a minimum of 75% of tumor cells. 6,7 Corresponding slides were digested using proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) overnight before DNA extraction using standard methods.


C-reactive protein was measured with a high-sensitivity reagent kit (CP 3847, Randox Laboratories Ltd, Crumlin, United Kingdom).

Definitions of Outcome Measures

Patients were followed up by telephone interviews and by medical records at 1 year.


Group D received pentobarbitone (Nembutal; Abbot BV, Amstelveen, The Netherlands) diluted to 15 mg/ml injected into an ear vein.


Color

Fillet surface color (CIE Lab) was assessed on all the fillets in the design (n = 80) by a digital photo imaging color-measuring system (DigiEye full system, VeriVide Ltd., Leicester, UK) after 7 d of storage. The fillets were placed in a standardized lightbox with daylight (6400 K) and photographed with a calibrated digital camera (Nikon D80, 35 mm lens, Nikon Corp., Japan).


NE tissue content was measured using a NE research ELISA kit (Demeditec Diagnostics GmbH, Kiel, Germany), fol-lowing the manufacturer's instructions.


The need for electrocauterization (Martin ME 82, KLS Martin Group, Tuttlingen, Germany) and/or for suturing (Seralon 5-0, Serag Wiessner GmbH & Co., Naila, Germany) to stop the bleeding was recorded separately.


Specific-IgE Measurements

Serum sIgE levels were determined by a screening method (ImmunoCAP, Phadiatop Infant™, Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden) against the same panel of inhalant and food allergens as listed above for SPT.


Internalization was analyzed using a LEICA TCS SP8 confocal microscope and the corresponding software (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany).

Colorimetric XTT cell proliferation assay

The cytotoxic activity of 425(scFv)-ETA′ against three different RMS cell lines (RD, FL-OH1 and TE-671) was determined using a cell proliferation assay based on XTT as previously described (Schiffer et al. 2013).
