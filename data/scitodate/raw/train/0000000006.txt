After a subsequent wash in PBS-T, membranes were incubated with a streptavidin conjugated Horseradish Peroxidase (Amersham, GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Little Chalfont, UK) diluted 1:3000 in PBS-T, for 1 h at room temperature.


Materials and Methods

The Endo-Model rotating-hinge knee prosthesis was developed in 1979 by Waldemar LINK GmbH (Hamburg, Germany). 3 The stem of the femoral component has a valgus angle of 6°.


Images were acquired with AxioVision (version 4.8.3.0; Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Jena, Germany). All neuronal cell bodies in the DRGs were identified as positive for bIII tubulin.


Pre-and post-surgery care

One hour before operation, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg; RB Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Berkshire, UK) was administrated subcutaneously (s/c) as analgesic.


Patient dosimetry is performed using external KAP-meter (RTI Electronics AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) and radiochromic films (Gafchromic XRRV2, International Specialty Products).


Monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was from Serotec Ltd (Oxford, UK). Polyclonal rabbit antimouse immunoglobulins/HRP was from Dakocytomation (Glostrup, Denmark).


The 40 kHz ultrasound apparatus was a standard ultrasonic cleaning bath 375H (Langford Electronics Ltd., Coventry, UK) with a maximal electrical energy output of 75 W.


The supernatant was evaporated until dryness (partial vacuum at 45°C, SPD2010 SpeedVac System, Thermo Fisher Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany). Residues were resolved in 200 μL of methanol, 77.5 mL of nanopure H 2 O, and 22.5 μL of HCl (10 mol/L).


Recording of the pupil diameter in darkness by near-infrared TV (television) pupillography was performed 20 minutes after dark adaptation using the compact integrated pupillograph (AMTech GmbH, Weinheim) in a standardized way. 8 Devices for automatic 24-hour recording of ambulatory BP (Boso GmbH, Jüngingen, Germany) were used at various measurement intervals (every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at night).


., the GenoType MTBDRplus assay (Hain Lifescience GmbH, Germany) (35)(36)(37). A notable drawback to these assays is that they are limited to detecting a specific set of mutations in the rpoB, katG, and inhA genes (e.g., the INNO-LiPA Rif.TB test detects only nine mutations in rpoB ) and cannot identify novel mutations conferring resistance (37), although certain assays do contain probes for wildtype alleles-observing a resistance phenotype and a wild-type allele would suggest a novel mutation but would not provide further details.


Cultures were synchronized in G1 with alpha factor mating pheromone for 3 h (CASLO ApS, Denmark). Tus expression was induced by adding 2% Galactose (final w/v) for the final 2.5 h of the G1-arrest.


Porphyromonas gingivalis was anaerobically cultured at 80% N 2 , 10% CO 2 , and 10% H 2 at 37 °C in an anaerobic chamber (Concept 400 Anaerobic Workstation; Ruskinn Technology Ltd., Leeds, UK) in fastidious anaerobe broth (29.7 g/L, pH 7.2).


The onion epidermal cells then were stained with propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) for nuclei and were observed with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg GmbH, Germany).

Yeast one-hybrid assays.

The interaction of OsWRKY13 protein with W or W-like box in a promoter region (Supplemental Table 3) was examined using a yeast one-hybrid assay according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech Yeast Protocols Handbook, BD Biosciences Clontech, Mountain View, CA, U.S.A.).


The clinical outcome was evaluated by comparing the preoperative to postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), noncontact specular microscopy (SP3000; Topcon Medical Europe BV, Capelle a/d IJssel, The Netherlands), anterior segment optical coherence tomography (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany), confocal microscopy (Confoscan 4; Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy), Scheimpflug imaging (Pentacam HR; Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany), and photo-slit-lamp biomicroscopy (Topcon Medical Europe BV).


Photomicrographs were produced using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (40 objective lens) with a digital camera (Carl Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany).

ATP Measurements. Cellular ATP content was determined by a luciferin/luciferase assay (Bihler and Jeanrenaud, 1970).


Afterwards they were placed in 20% EDTA (Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany) for 4e5 weeks at 37 C. Decalcification medium was changed every 2 or 3 days.


All straylight measurements were done using the C-Quant (Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany), employing the psychophysical compensation comparison method developed by van den Berg. 10,11 The procedure was similar to those previously reported. 12,13 The patient was instructed to look through an eyepiece with one eye, while the other eye was patched.


The citric acid aerosol, generated by a jet nebulizer (PARI jet nebulizer, Paul Ritzau, Pari-Werk GmbH, Germany, output 5 L s −1 , particles mass median diameter 1.2 í µí¼m), was delivered to the head chamber of the plethysmograph for 3 min.


BIBO3304 was supplied by Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma GmbH (Rheinland Palatinate, Germany) and L152804 was from Banyu (Banyu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).


The arterial blood pressure set was connected, and the transducer was placed at the level of the heart and zeroed. The LiDCOplus monitor (LiDCO Ltd., Cambridge, United Kingdom) 26 was connected for continuous hemodynamic monitoring.
