Having been blocked in a blocking buffer-TBS, pH 7.5, containing 100 mM Tris-HCl, 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20 [TBS-T], and 1% bovine serum albumin, sections were incubated with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies against hCG (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and sheep polyclonal antibodies against LH/hCGR (Biotrend Chemikalien GmbH, Cologne, Germany), both diluted 1:200 in the same solution for 60 min at 37°C in a humidified chamber and washed for 60 min in TBS-T.


Spirometry: FEV 1 was measured by spirometer (Master Screen, Erich Jaeger GmbH, Wuerzburg, Germany); the highest of three successive measurements was taken.


Maleic acid (99% pure, lot 4039128) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Steinheim, Germany). Sodium oleate (82.7% pure, lot 51110) was obtained from Riedel-de Haën, Seelze, Germany.


The integral data were grouped and sorted, and then the spectral intensity was normalized to a unit area with the appropriate weighting coefficients in Microsoft ® Excel spreadsheets prior to importing into the SIMCA-P v11.0 software package (Umetrics AB, Umeå, Sweden) for multivariate data analysis. PCA was conducted for the entire dataset using mean-centered data.


The reaction was carried out in 50 ml volumes containing 0.3 mg/ml BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin), 250 mM dTNPs, 0.5 mM of each primer, 0.02 U Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes OY, Espoo, Finland) and 5x Phusion HF Buffer containing 1.5 mM MgCl 2 .


Expired 13 CO 2 enrichment was measured using a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS, Isoprime Ltd, Cheadle, UK) and expressed as atom percent excess (APE) when compared against a reference standard of compressed CO 2 . a Healthy children were selected to represent the wide range in age of PKU children recruited for the study (see Table 2).


Previous studies (e.g. 17) have shown when such feedback is used, there are no significant changes in the levels of activity maintained by the *Digitimer Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK. † Gould Electronics Inc., Chandler, AZ, USA. subjects from one sequence to another.


Immunodepletion of DNA helicase and ssDNA-dependent ATPase activities of PfH45

Aliquots of 30 nM purified PfH45 were incubated separately at 4 °C for 16 h with 2 μg of PfH45 IgG, preimmune IgG or penta-His antibodies (Qiagen, GmbH, Germany). Immunodepletion was performed by adding 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham) equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0).


The applied voltage was monitored using an oscilloscope (TDS 210, Tektronix, UK Ltd., Bracknell, UK). Microscopy pictures and videos were generated using a Dino-Lite digital microscope (AM413T5 Dino-Lite Pro, AnMo Electronics Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan).


Twin-beam DE-CTA was performed using a 128-slice singlesource CT scanner (CT Definition AS+; Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) equipped with a split-filter and a single-layer integrated circuit detector (Stellar; Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany).


PCR was performed with specific primers using 200 ng of the bisulfite-modified genomic DNA as templates and EpiTect MSP kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany). The cycling conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 31 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, the PCR products (15 μl) were resolved on a 3% agarose gel.


Gene Ontology Analysis

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using GOSSIP 27 -a freely available software package that tests whether a molecular function, biological process or cellular location described in the GO system (http://www.geneontology.org/), the so-called GO terms, is significantly associated with a group of interesting genes when compared with a reference group (MicroDiscovery GmbH, Berlin, Germany).

cDNA Synthesis, Quantitative Real-Time PCR and Statistical Analysis cDNA was obtained by oligo(dT) 16 -primed reverse transcription of 1 mg total RNA using SuperScript II (Invitrogen).
